I'm Rafael, a brazilian software developer currently living on the beautiful Barcelona.

I work at [GFT][gft], where I focus on web performance. In 2015 and 2016 I helped prototype and build what eventually became [Airbnb Experiences][experiences]. Before that I helped bring [Findery][findery] to life.

Iâ€™m also a speaker at local front end, **Angular.js**, and **Node.js** meetups, and I also presented a session at [The Developers Conference][tdc].

Find me on [twitter][twitter], [github][github] or [linkedin][linkedin]
