I'm Rafael, a brazilian software developer currently living on the beautiful Barcelona.

I work at [GFT][gft], where I focus on web development and performance for financial apps. In 2016 I helped prototype and build [Creditas][creditas], one of the most exciting products of FinTech market in Brazil. Before that I helped bring [Tripda][tripda] to life.

I speak about front-end stuff at some meetup groups, and I've presented sessions at [The Developers Conference][tdc] in 2014 and 2015.
